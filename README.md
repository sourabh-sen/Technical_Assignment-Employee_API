# Technical_Assignment-Employee_API
Developed a function or simple CLI (Command Line Interface) solution that leverages an external API. Your submission should handle authentication and provide a method or API endpoint to fetch employee data from the provided platform.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

We need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

- install [Node.js, NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 

- install [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) globally

    ```bash
    $ npm install -g typescript
    ```

### Step 2: Need to change variables

- Put your API_KEY, EmployeeId, and companySubDomain in src\controllers\employee.ts file

### Step 3: How to Initiate

- Take a clone of repository,

- Run following commands:

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    $ npm run dev
    ```

We will get,

`Server Running: ðŸ‘‰ https://localhost:8000` 

It will automatically call the API and fetch the required data as per the given interface. Data will be visible on CLI (Command Line Interface)
